# Question Paper Generator

This project is a **Question Paper Generator** web application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and Python. It allows users (teachers, educators, or students) to generate question papers for different classes, subjects, and topics, using both a database of real questions and AI-generated questions.

---

## Features

1. **Chapter Selection**

   - Chapters are class- and subject-specific.
   - Chapter list updates based on selected class and subject.

2. **Class and Subject Selection**

   - User selects class (6–10) and relevant subject.

3. **Question Types and Count**

   - User can select the number of questions for:
     - MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions)
     - Fill in the Blanks
     - True/False
     - Descriptive Questions

4. **Smart AI-Based Question Generation**

   - Objective questions are generated by AI using relevant topic content.
   - Questions are distributed equally based on content relevance.

5. **Descriptive Questions from Database**

   - Descriptive questions are stored in the database with marks and type.
   - Fetched directly if available.

6. **AI Fallback**

   - If the database lacks enough questions, AI auto-generates them to fulfill the count.

7. **Textbook Content**

   - Chapter-wise textbook content is inserted into the database.
   - Used as context for question generation.

8. **Descriptive Question Push**

   - AI-generated descriptive questions are saved to MongoDB.

9. **Customizable Distribution**  
   Distributes questions across selected topics as per user input.
10. **CSV Export**

- All question data can be exported using:
  ```sh
  python db_csv.py
  ```

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for the web UI)
- **MongoDB** (for storing questions and textbook content)
- **Groq API** (for AI question generation)
- **python-dotenv** (for environment variable management)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Saxena-Shivam/question-generator.git
   cd question-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _(Or manually: `pip install streamlit pymongo groq python-dotenv`)_

3. **Set up your `.env` file**  
   Create a `.env` file (or edit the provided one) with your API keys:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB**  
   Make sure your MongoDB URI and database/collection names in the code match your setup.

5. **Run the app**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
